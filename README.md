# _UFOs_

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to develop a dynmaic website that allowed users to input different search criteria which would then filter the data of recorded UFO sightings. In order to do this user input fields were developed for Date, City, State, Country, and Shape. Any information added to these fields would be pulled and used to filter and repopulate the table with the relevant data. The deployed site can be found at: https://stellalilien.github.io/_UFOs_/

## Results
How to perform a search:

## Summary
One drawback of the website as it is currrently designed is that the input fields need exact matches which can create problems on the user end. For further development I would recommend adding detailed search instructions to make the steps clear to all users and also a message to populate if no matches are found. In it's current state nothing will appear but it isn't always clear if that is a lack of results or if the search didn't work. I also think allowing the date field to accept a range of dates would be preferable.
